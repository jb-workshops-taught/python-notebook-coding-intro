<h1>Download and Upload</h1>

<span>The next several lessons will require that you download a lesson file, and
then upload it to Jupyter so you can use it.  Let's practice that.</span>

<p>Here is a notebook file.  Right-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac) to "Save link as" 
a file on your computer.  <a href="sample.ipynb">Download sample.ipynb</a></p>

<p>Now go back to Jupyter and pick menu <strong>File, Open</strong>, then click the <strong>Upload</strong>
button.</p>
<p>Choose the sample.ipynb file you just downloaded, and click okay.</p>
<p>Then press the blue <strong>Upload</strong> button next to the file.<br>
