<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>Open a new browser tab to <a style="font-size: x-large;" href="https://try.jupyter.org/">Jupyter.org</a> to start.</p>

<p>You'll get something that looks like the following.<br>
Choose <strong>New</strong> and then <strong>Python 3</strong>. <br>

<p>Now you have a notebook to work in.  It looks like this.<br>

<h1>Running Code</h1>

<p>Each <strong>cell</strong> or box is a place where you can type in source code.<br>
Type this in the box:</p>

<div class="code">print("Hello world!")</div>

<p>After you type it in, press <strong>control-enter</strong> to
run it.  (If you're on a tablet without control or alt keys, click the "Play" icon instead.)
See the message show up underneath the box?</p>

<P>Let's do another example. But first we need another box!<br><br>
Click into the box you already typed in.  This time, run it by pressing 
<strong>alt-enter</strong>.<br>
Notice that it creates a new blank box after, for you to write in.<br>

<p>Type this into the second box, and run it with control-enter or alt-enter.  Type carefully!
If you make a mistake or get an error, click into the box and fix your typing.  Then run it
again with <strong>control-enter</strong>.</p>

<div class="code">print("I can do math.  Want to see?")
answer = 5 + 3
print("Here's the answer! ")
print(answer)
