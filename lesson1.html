<H1>How do I get started writing programming code?</H1>

<p>Open a new browser tab to <a style="font-size: x-large;" 
href="http://52.7.46.111:8000/" target="_new">CoderGirl Jupyter Temporary Notebooks</a>.</p>

<blockquote>If that site isn't working, see <a href="jupyter_org.html">instructions on using 
try.jupyter.org</a> instead. <br>
(Warning: the alternative has a 10-minute idle timeout! You can easily lose your work there.)</blockquote>

<p>Jupyter will show a list of files.  These are the lesson files you will work in.<br><br>

They will save your work, but it will only last as long as you are still working on them.
Once you are idle for 1 hour, the session will end.  That means when you walk away for
dinner or sleep, the files will go away.  We'll show you how to download
and save your work, so you can continue across several days.<br><br>

But first, let's see what Jupyter can do.
<br>

<img src="jupyter_lessons.png" width="70%"></p>

<p>Click "New" to start a new notebook from scratch.  The notebook looks like this.  
You can click on "Untitled" to change the filename.  You might want to put
your name in there, like Jenny Practice or whatever you like. <br>
<img src="jupyter2.png" width="70%"></p>

<p>There is a File menu.  It has a Save-and-Checkpoint menu item in it.  Click that now to save
your new notebook.</p>

<h1>Running Code</h1>

<p>Each <strong>cell</strong> or box is a place where you can type in source code.<br>
Type this in the box:</p>

<div class="code">print("Hello world!")</div>

<p>After you type it in, press <strong>control-enter</strong> to
run it.  (If you're on a tablet without control or alt keys, click the "Play" icon instead.)
See the message show up underneath the box?</p>

<P>Let's do another example. But first we need another box!<br><br>
Click into the box you already typed in.  This time, run it by pressing 
<strong>alt-enter</strong>.<br>
Notice that it creates a new blank box after, for you to write in.<br>

<p>Type this into the second box, and run it with control-enter or alt-enter.  Type carefully!
If you make a mistake or get an error, click into the box and fix your typing.  Then run it
again with <strong>control-enter</strong>.<br>

<div class="code">print("I can do math.  Want to see?")
answer = 5 + 3
print("Here's the answer! ")
print(answer)
</div>

<h1>Continuing Your Work the Next Day</h1>

<p>Now, let's learn how to download your work-in-progress.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure your file has a name, something besides "Untitled". Click on "Untitled" to change it.</li>
<li>Click File, and click Save and Checkpoint.</li>
<li>Click File, and click Download as, "IPython Notebook".</li>
<li>Pay attention to where your web browser is downloading to.</li>
<li>Find the file on your computer.  If it has a .txt file extension, rename it
to .ipynb instead. Some computers add txt automatically, but it interferes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, let's restore your work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on the Jupyter logo in the upper-left, to go back to the list of files.</li>
<li>Find the Upload button in the upper right.</li>
<li>Click Upload, and choose the file you saved to your computer in the prior step.</li>
<li>Jupyter will show a pending upload, but with a blue Upload button.  Click 
the blue button to start the upload.</li>
<li>It probably matches the filename you already have, so tell it "Overwrite" the file 
if needed.</li>
<li>Watch the progress meter run (might be quick).</li>
<li>Your file is ready.  Click on it to go into the notebook and continue your work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now click on the Jupyter logo in the upper-left, to go back to the list of files.
See the list of lesson files?  They're numbered.  Each lesson goes with
one of the pages on this web site.  There are practice problems inside each
lesson file.</p>
