<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>Open a new browser tab to <a style="font-size: x-large;" href="https://try.jupyter.org/">Jupyter.org</a> to start.</p>

<p>You'll get something that looks like the following.<br>
Choose <strong>New</strong> and then <strong>Python 3</strong>. <br>

<p>Now you have a notebook to work in.  It looks like this.<br>

<h1>Running Code</h1>

<p>Each <strong>cell</strong> or box is a place where you can type in source code.<br>
Type this in the box:</p>

<div class="code">print("Hello world!")</div>

<p>After you type it in, press <strong>control-enter</strong> to run it.  See the message show up
underneath the box?</p>

<P>Let's do another example. But first we need another box!<br>
Click into the box you already typed in.  This time, run it by pressing 
<strong>alt-enter</strong>.<br>
Notice that it creates a new blank box after, for you to write in.<br>

<p>Type this into the second box, and run it with control-enter or alt-enter.  Type carefully!
If you make a mistake or get an error, click into the box and fix your typing.  Then run it
again with <strong>control-enter</strong>.</p>

<div class="code">print("I can do math.  Want to see?")
answer = 5 + 3
print("Here's the answer! ")
print(answer)
</div>

<h1>Download and Upload</h1>

<span>The next several lessons will require that you download a lesson file, and
then upload it to Jupyter so you can use it.  Let's practice that.</span>

<p>Here is a notebook file.  Right-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac) to "Save link as" 
a file on your computer.  <a href="sample.ipynb">Download sample.ipynb</a></p>

<p>Now go back to Jupyter and pick menu <strong>File, Open</strong>, then click the <strong>Upload</strong>
button.</p>
<p>Choose the sample.ipynb file you just downloaded, and click okay.</p>
<p>Then press the blue <strong>Upload</strong> button next to the file.<br>
<img src="jupyter_upload1.png" width="70%"></p>
<p>The file is uploaded.  Find its name at the bottom of the list, and click the name to open it.</p>
