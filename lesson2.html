<h1>Lesson Structure</h1>

<p>The next several pages will lead you through some 
practice exercises to learn about coding.  Type in
the code shown, in an input box <code>In [*]</code> at Jupyter.org,
and press control-enter to run it.</p>

<p>Code looks like this.</p>

<div class="code">print "Hello"</div>

<p>Read the lesson for understanding.</p>
<p>Type the python code into Jupyter and run it.</p>
<p>Try to understand what the code does and why.</p>
<p>Make it do something else.</p>
<p>Move on to the next part of the lesson.</p>
<p>Ask a mentor or classmate questions when you need clarification.</p>

<h1>Setup done. Let's Code!!!</h1>

<h1>Variables</h1>

<p>To save a number or word, we have to give it a name.  The name is
called a <strong>variable</strong> because its value can vary; it can
change over time.  Here are some variables and their values.</p>

<div class="code">x = 10
y = 20
name = "Jenny"
firstLetter = "J"
howManyApples = 5
</div>

<p>When you set a variable's value, that is called <strong>assigning</strong> a value to the variable.</p>

<p>The + symbol does addition and - does subtraction.  What value does the <strong>total</strong> variable hold below?  
Copy-paste into Jupyter and run it.  Were you right?</p>

<div class="code">total = 2 + 4 + 3 - 1
print(total)
</div>

<p>The / symbol does division, like a fraction would.  What value does the <strong>average</strong> 
variable hold?  Copy-paste into Jupyter and run it.  Were you right?</p>

<div class="code">average = (5 + 6 + 6 + 3) / 4
print(average)
</div>

<p>The * symbol does multiplication.  In the next example, a customer is buying 3 loaves of bread
which cost $1.99 each.  The sales tax is 5%.  What is the total price of their order?
Copy-paste into Jupyter and run it.  How does the computer do the calculation?</p>

<div class="code">howMany = 3
priceEach = 1.99
salesTaxPercent = 0.05
totalPrice = (howMany * priceEach) + (salesTaxPercent * (howMany * priceEach))
print(totalPrice)
</div>

<p>The <strong>counter</strong> variable below demonstrates that the variable's value can be reassigned:
you can keep assigning new values to it.  It remembers only the most recent value.  Copy and paste it 
into Jupyter and run it.  What does it print?</p>

<div class="code">counter = 0
counter = 1
counter = 2
counter = 3
counter = 4
print(counter)
</div>

<p>Here's another example of assigning new values.  Can you guess what it prints?  Run it.</p>
<div class="code">counter = 7
counter = 5
counter = 100
print(counter)
counter = 3
counter = -42
print(counter)
</div>

<p>The next example uses String variables.  <strong>String</strong> means text - letters, punctuation, words, 
and sentences.  The name comes from "a string of letters" like an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=alphabet+bead+bracelet&espv=2&biw=1047&bih=665&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIstrbhMT5xgIVgZQNCh3Xuwce">alphabet bead bracelet</a>.  A single letter or punctuation mark is called a <strong>character</strong>.  A string is a way to put together many
characters, to represent human text.  Any value inside "double quote marks" is a string.</p>

<p>Run this code example.  What does it do?</p>

<div class="code">print("Good morning!")
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hi " + name + ".  It's good to meet you!")
</div>

<div class="note">Note: If you get an error like "NameError: name 'Jenny' is not defined" then 
you are using Python 2.  Fix this by choosing File, New, Python 3 Notebook. Or, 
change <em>input</em> to <em>raw_input</em>.</div>

<p>In the previous example, why is the word <em>name</em> printed as <em>name</em> in the second 
line, but the variable value (<em>Jenny</em>) is printed instead in the third line?  If you're
not sure, keep reading below.</p>

<p>When <em>name</em> is inside a string (inside a matched pair of double quotes), 
the letters n-a-m-e are printed out.  But when it's not inside double quotes, 
the computer understands it as part of your source code, such as a variable, 
and it interprets it and prints the value stored inside of it instead.</p>

<div class="code">name = "My name is Jenny"
print(name)
print("What is my name? " + name)
</div>

<p>Multiple strings can be combined into one string by putting + between them.  This isn't
numeric addition.  It's called <strong>concatenation</strong> which means combining one
after the other.  Here's an example.<br>

<div class="code">alpha = "Alpha"
bet = "BET"
text = "example"
phrase = alpha + bet + text
print(phrase)
</div>

<p>If you want to print a number variable next to a string, using string concatenation,
you have to turn the number into a string first, by wrapping str() around it.  This
tells the computer you do intend to treat the number as if it's a string.  This is one
solution to the error "TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly".</p>

<div class="code">words = "Some words"
num = 3
print(words + str(num))
</div>

<p>The other solution is to use a comma in the print statement instead, like this.</p>

<div class="code">words = "Some words"
num = 3
print(words, num)
</div>

<p>If you want the person to type in a number, you can use input(), but you need an 
extra step.  int() is the opposite of str().  It converts from a string to a number.
If you forget int() you will see either "TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly"
or you will see "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'".<br><br>

In either case, <strong>casting</strong> the string as an integer number will let you
do math with it.</p>

<div class="code">num = input("Type a number: ")

bigger = int(num) + 1
print("The next bigger number is ", bigger)

smaller = int(num) - 2
print("Two smaller is ", smaller)
</div>

<p><strong>Casting</strong> changes the <strong>data type</strong> of a value or variable.  
In python, which is what we're using here, numbers and strings are the basic data types you 
use.  In other programming languages, there are multiple kinds of numbers, and each is a different
data type.  Here are some examples.  An integer is a counting
number like 1, 2, 3, 4, or -1, -2, -3, -4, with no decimal places.  A decimal or
floating point number has values after the decimal place, like 3.14 or 1.01, or
2.0000 as well.  Casting 3.14 to an integer makes it a 3 instead.  Casting 3 (the integer)
to a float makes it 3.0000 instead.  Integer and float are data types.  String is also a
data type.</p>

<p>You won't see casting very much in python (except, as shown above, to convert a string
to a number).  But when you start exploring other programming languages, you may
use it more.  It helps to know what the word means, even if you're not using it yet.</p>

<hr>

<p>When you're writing code, sometimes it helps to leave yourself notes.
You can do this by putting <strong>comments</strong> in the code.  A
comment is a line that starts with # and it will be ignored when running the
code, so it's okay to write English sentences.  Here's an example.</p>

<div class="code">num = input("Type a number: ")

# This is a comment.  I can also comment out a 
# line of code to make it be skipped.
bigger = int(num) + 1
# print("The next bigger number is ", bigger)

smaller = int(num) - 2
print("Two smaller is ", smaller)
</div>

<p>Another way to help your code make sense is to choose good variable names.  A
good name tells you something about the real-world meaning of the value it holds.
For instance, <em>firstName</em> and <em>lastName</em> are good variable names when
the program asks the person at the keyboard for their name.</p>

<p>You could use <em>f</em> and <em>l</em> but that's a little confusing; what if somewhere 
else in your program, you wanted a variable whose name also started with f?  You might
not remember which is which; you might start to mix them up, and make mistakes.  Single-letter 
variable names make it difficult to read the code.  That makes it hard to know what you did 
when you come back to your work later.  You can make it easier on your brain by choosing 
longer, more useful names.</p>

<table cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="1" bgcolor="white">
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Good or bad?</th></tr>
<tr><td>m</td><td>minimum of a bunch of numbers</td>
<td>Bad: m can also mean maximum!</td></tr>
<tr><td>min</td><td>minimum of a bunch of numbers</td>
<td>Good: fairly distinctive, not easily mistaken for something else</td></tr>
<tr><td>ac</td><td>apple count; how many apples</td>
<td>Bad: hard to guess at later if you forget what it is</td></tr>
<tr><td>appleCount</td><td>apple count; how many apples</td>
<td>Good: very clear</td></tr>
<tr><td>appleCost</td><td>Cost of one apple</td>
<td>Good: Uses full words, gives an idea of its purpose.<br>
Bad: Doesn't indicate units; could be misused</td></tr>
<tr><td>perAppleCostInDollars</td><td>Cost of one apple</td>
<td>Very good: Units are very clear and mathematical meaning is obvious</td></tr>

<h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
<div>You've learned about variables, strings, and math.  Now it's your turn to write code! 
We've made a file with practice exercises.  You'll need to save the file and upload it
to Jupyter so you can work through it.
<br>

<p>Here is an ipython notebook file.  Right-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac) to "Save link as" 
a file on your computer.  <br><a href="sample.ipynb">Download sample.ipynb</a></p>

<p>Now go back to Jupyter and pick menu <strong>File, Open</strong>, then click 
the <strong>Upload</strong> button.</p>

<p>Choose the sample.ipynb file you just downloaded, and click okay.</p>

<p>Then press the blue <strong>Upload</strong> button next to the file.<br>
<img src="jupyter_upload1.png" width="70%"></p>
<p>The file is uploaded.  Find its name at the bottom of the list, and click the name to open it.</p>

<img src="jupyter5_sample.png" width="70%">

<P>Good job - that's how you save, upload, and open a notebook.  You can also use Jupyter's
file menu to download your notebook when you've worked on it, to save your own code for later.
Next, download the lesson2exercises.ipynb file (below) and upload it to Jupyter.
Click the filename in Jupyter to open it.  Work the exercises inside the file, to
practice using variables.</p>
