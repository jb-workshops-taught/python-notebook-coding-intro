<h1>Variables</h1>

<p>To save a number or word, we have to give it a name.  The name is
called a <strong>variable</strong> because its value can vary; it can
change over time.  Here are some variables and their values.</p>

<div class="code">x = 10
y = 20
name = "Jenny"
firstLetter = "J"
howManyApples = 5
</div>

<p>When you set a variable's value, that is called <strong>assigning</strong> a value to the variable.</p>

<p>The + symbol does addition and - does subtraction.  What value does the <strong>total</strong> variable hold below?  
Copy-paste into Jupyter and run it.  Were you right?</p>

<div class="code">total = 2 + 4 + 3 - 1
print(total)
</div>

<p>The / symbol does division, like a fraction would.  What value does the <strong>average</strong> 
variable hold?  Copy-paste into Jupyter and run it.  Were you right?</p>

<div class="code">average = (5 + 6 + 6 + 3) / 4
print(average)
</div>

<p>The * symbol does multiplication.  In the next example, a customer is buying 3 loaves of bread
which cost $1.99 each.  The sales tax is 5%.  What is the total price of their order?
Copy-paste into Jupyter and run it.  How does the computer do the calculation?</p>

<div class="code">howMany = 3
priceEach = 1.99
salesTaxPercent = 0.05
totalPrice = (howMany * priceEach) + (salesTaxPercent * (howMany * priceEach))
print(totalPrice)
</div>

<p>The <strong>counter</strong> variable below demonstrates that the variable's value can be reassigned:
you can keep assigning new values to it.  It remembers only the most recent value.  Copy and paste it 
into Jupyter and run it.  What does it print?</p>

<div class="code">counter = 0
counter = 1
counter = 2
counter = 3
counter = 4
print(counter)
</div>

<p>Here's another example of assigning new values.  Can you guess what it prints?  Run it.</p>
<div class="code">counter = 7
counter = 5
counter = 100
print(counter)
counter = 3
counter = -42
print(counter)
</div>

<p>The next example uses String variables.  <strong>String</strong> means text - letters, punctuation, words, 
and sentences.  The name comes from "a string of letters" like an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=alphabet+bead+bracelet&espv=2&biw=1047&bih=665&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIstrbhMT5xgIVgZQNCh3Xuwce">alphabet bead bracelet</a>.  A single letter or punctuation mark is called a <strong>character</strong>.  A string is a way to put together many
characters, to represent human text.  Any value inside "double quote marks" is a string.</p>

<p>Run this code example.  What does it do?</p>

<div class="code">print("Good morning!")
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hi " + name + ".  It's good to meet you!")
</div>

<div class="note">Note: If you get an error like "NameError: name 'Jenny' is not defined" then 
you are using Python 2.  Fix this by choosing File, New, Python 3 Notebook. Or, 
change <em>input</em> to <em>raw_input</em>.</div>

<p>In the previous example, why is the word <em>name</em> printed as <em>name</em> in the second 
line, but the variable value (<em>Jenny</em>) is printed instead in the third line?  If you're
not sure, keep reading below.</p>

<p>When <em>name</em> is inside a string (inside a matched pair of double quotes), 
the letters n-a-m-e are printed out.  But when it's not inside double quotes, 
the computer understands it as part of your source code, such as a variable, 
and it interprets it and prints the value stored inside of it instead.</p>

<div class="code">name = "My name is Jenny"
print(name)
print("What is my name? " + name)
</div>

<p>Multiple strings can be combined into one string by putting + between them.  This isn't
numeric addition.  It's called <strong>concatenation</strong> which means combining one
after the other.  Here's an example.<br>

<div class="code">alpha = "Alpha"
bet = "BET"
text = "example"
phrase = alpha + bet + text
print(phrase)
</div>

<p>If you want to print a number variable next to a string, using string concatenation,
you have to turn the number into a string first, by wrapping str() around it.  This
tells the computer you do intend to treat the number as if it's a string.  This is one
solution to the error "TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly".</p>

<div class="code">words = "Some words"
num = 3
print(words + str(num))
</div>

<p>The other solution is to use a comma in the print statement instead, like this.</p>

<div class="code">words = "Some words"
num = 3
print(words, num)
</div>

<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Variables: Learning Goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create number and text variables.</li>
<li>Give variables meaningful names.</li>
<li>Do math with variables and save the results.</li>
<li>Get input from the keyboard.</li>
<li>Print the values of variables alone and with other text.</li>
<li>Recognize string concatenation.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Variables: Concept Summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Variables name a location in computer memory that stores a value.</li>
<li>Assign a value to a variable to change what's held inside it.</li>
<li>Input prompts the user to enter information. Whatever the user types is assigned to a variable.</li>
<li>Math can be done with + addition, - subtraction, * multiplication, and / division.</li>
<li>You can also use + to concatenate text strings one after the other.</li>
<li>Use print to show the value of a variable.</li>
<li>Text inside "double quotes" gets treated as text, not as variables.  It's printed as-is.</li>
</ol>
