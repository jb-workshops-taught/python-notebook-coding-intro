<h1>How does a computer make decisions?</h1>

<p>A computer does different things depending on circumstances.  For instance, if your
online shopping cart is empty, it might show "Empty cart" but if it has items in it,
it shows those items.  How does it decide?</p>


<h1>If Statements and Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>What if we want to make the computer say something different, depending
on what the user at the keyboard typed in?  How do we do that?  Try this
example.  What does it do?</p>

<div class="code">time = input("Is it morning or night? ")
if(time == "morning"):
    print("Good morning!")
else:
    print("Have a great night.")
</div>

<P>Notice how we use a single = when we're <strong>assigning</strong> a variable's value, but
we use a double == (two equal signs in a row) when we're <strong>comparing</strong>
two values to ask the question, "Are these equal? Are they the same?"</p>

<p>The comparison gives us a true/false or yes/no answer.  That's called a <strong>boolean</strong> value.
Here are some variables that hold boolean values.  What does this code print?  Why?</p>

<div class="code">a = 5
b = 5

same = (a == b)
print("Are they the same? ", same)

greater = (a > b)
print("Is a greater than b? ", greater)

lesser = (a < 9)
print("Is a less than 9? ", lesser)

</div>

<p>Here's a deeper explanation of comparisons.  There are several kinds of comparisons
that a computer can do.  It can compare whether numbers are the same, less than, or
greater than.  It can also compare as "less than or equal to" and as "greater than or
equal to".  Numbers are the easiest to compare, but letters can be compared as well, which
lets us sort things alphabetically.</p>

<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="1" bgcolor="white">
<tr><th>Comparison</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>a &lt; b</td><td>Is the value of a less than the value of b?</td>
<td>3 &lt; 4 is true<br>"aaa" &lt; "bbb" is true</td></tr>
<tr><td>a &gt; b</td><td>Is the value of a greater than the value of b?</td>
<td>3 &gt; 4 is false<br>"bbb" &gt; "aaa" is true</td></tr>
<tr><td>a == b</td><td>Is the value of a exactly equal to the value of b?</td>
<td>3 == 3 is true<br>"aaa" == "aaa" is true</td></tr>
<tr><td>a &lt;= b</td><td>Is the value of a less than or equal to the value of b?</td>
<td>3 &lt;= 4 is true<br>4 &lt;= 4 is true<br>"aaa" &lt;= "aaa" is true</td></tr>
<tr><td>a &gt;= b</td><td>Is the value of a greater than or equal to the value of b?</td>
<td>3 &gt;= 4 is false<br>4 &gt;= 4 is true<br>"bbb" &gt;= "aaa" is true</td></tr>
<tr><td>a != b</td><td>Is the value of a not equal to the value of b?</td>
<td>3 != 4 is true<br>4 != 4 is false<br>"cat" != "dog" is true</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You'll use those comparison operators a lot.  <strong>Operator</strong> means the
punctuation marks used to make a comparison, for example, &lt; &gt; == and !=. Eventually
you will have these memorized, from practicing with them and using them so much.</p>

<p>Now let's look at a longer version of the first example (below).  When the user types 
in "morning", then the first <strong>block of code</strong> indented inside 
the <strong>if statement</strong> will run.  This is because the (time == "morning") 
<strong>condition</strong> is true.  When the if condition is true, the first 
indented block runs; otherwise, the else indented block runs.<br><br>

The final line is not indented, so it's not part of the if-else statement.  
No matter what the if statement does, the last line prints anyway.<br><br>

Try running it. The first time, put in morning, and watch what it prints.  Run it
again and put in night, and watch what it prints.  What is the same both 
times? What is different?<br><br>

Modify it to add an extra print statement to the night message that doesn't show up 
if you type in morning.</p>

<div class="code">time = input("Is it morning or night? ")
if(time == "morning"):
    print("Good morning!")
    print("I so enjoy the beginning of the day.")
else:
    print("Have a great night.")
print("It was nice to meet you.")
</div>

<p>You use if statements to make decisions in code.  Here's an example.  Read slowly 
through the code.  What do you understand?  What's new or unfamiliar?  How does
the logic work?  Can you work the math with paper and pencil to prove the code right or wrong?</p>

<div class="code">print("I want to buy candy for my friends.  I have 50 cents available.")
print("If I can buy at least 5 candies, then I will buy candy. But if I can't")
print("buy enough for all 5 of my friends, then I won't buy any candy.")
print("")

money = 50
candyPieces = 0

priceText = input("How many cents does each piece of candy cost? ")
priceEach = int(priceText)

print("")
if (money / priceEach >= 5):
    print("I have enough! I will buy the candy.")
    candyPieces = money // priceEach
    money = money - (candyPieces * priceEach)
else:
    print("I can't make everyone happy.  I won't buy the candy.")

print("I have this much money left: ", money)
print("I have this many pieces of candy: ", candyPieces)
</div>

<p>Using the same example, here is a table showing the results of a
few different candy prices.  See if you can figure out what // is doing.  Try
changing it to just one / and rerun the code, comparing to this chart.  Try
several difference prices.  What's different?  Change it back to // and run again.</p>

<table bgcolor="white" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" style="text-align: center;">
<tr><th>Price&nbsp;Each</th><th>Candies</th><th>Pennies Spent</th><th>Pennies Left</th></tr>
<tr><td>1&cent;</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>2&cent;</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>3&cent;</td><td>16</td><td>48</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>4&cent;</td><td>12</td><td>48</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>5&cent;</td><td>10</td><td>50</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>6&cent;</td><td>8</td><td>48</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>7&cent;</td><td>7</td><td>49</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>8&cent;</td><td>6</td><td>48</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>9&cent;</td><td>5</td><td>45</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>10&cent;</td><td>5</td><td>50</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>11&cent;</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>12&cent;</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>13&cent;</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>14&cent;</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>50</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can also use an if statement with only one branch, like this.
What prints if you run it? If you change the 5 to a 7, what prints?</p>

<div class="code">print("Hello")
a = 5
if (a == 7):
    print("7 is a special number.")
print("Goodbye")
</div>

<p>You can nest if statements as well.  Watch the indentation! Run this a 
few times and type in different answers.  Try to understand how it works.
(Note: <em>elif</em> is a contraction from "else if".)</p>

<div class="code">time = input("What time of day is it? Answer day or night: ")
season = input("What season is it? Answer winter, summer, or spring: ")
print("")
if (season == "winter"):
    if(time == "day"):
        print("Winter in the daytime can be very bright with snow.")
    else:
        print("Winter at night is beautiful with moonlight on the snow.")
elif (season == "summer"):
    if(time == "day"):
        print("Summer days are for play!")
    else:
        print("Summer nights are warm but not bright.")
else:
    if(time == "day"):
        print("Spring flowers are so colorful in the daytime rain.")
    else:
        print("Spring nights are chilly.")
print("See you later!")
</div>

<div>You can combine if statements and other code in many ways to accomplish more complex
decisions and behavior changes.  You'll get more practice with the notebook exercises coming up soon.
But first, let's figure out what to do when things go wrong!</div>

<h1>Troubleshooting Strategies</h1>

<div>As you work with code, you'll encounter mistakes, typos, and
misunderstandings.  Some of these will put errors up in your
face in Jupyter, and others will result in incorrect print output 
but otherwise no indicator of what went wrong.  How do you find
the problem?</div>

<p>Use print statements to inspect variables, to find out if they
really hold the value you think they do.</p>

<p>Break the problem down into smaller steps.  Check your logic on
each part before bringing the parts together.</p>

<p>Break your code apart into separate boxes, no more than a few
lines in each one, and run the parts separately (but in the
correct order).  Print the values you're curious about at the 
end of each box.  This helps you narrow down where the problem is.</p>

<p>Write your ideas out on paper, step by step, in English.  Make
sure they are coherent and make sense before you try to write 
the code to match.</p>

<p>Come up with test values to put in, like we did with candy prices.
Make sure the math checks out on paper.  Make sure you know how it behaves
for weird inputs like zero, one, or negative one.<br><br>

(How many candies can you get for zero cents each? Try it.)  Make sure 
you understand any issues with decimal rounding as well (hint, hint).</p>
