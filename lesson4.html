<h1>How can we reuse code?</h1>

<p>Sometimes we need the computer to do the same thing in several places.  We could retype
the code, but what if we make a typo?  How can we save that effort and reduce the likelihood
of mistakes?  Can we make the code in a way where, if that piece changes, we only have
to change the code in one spot?</p>


<h1>Functions</h1>

<p>Sometimes, in code, we have several steps that we want to reuse.  We can do this by
creating a <strong>function</strong>.  A function is a named set of steps.  To define a function, you
put <em>def</em> and then its name, followed parentheses ().  If the function needs
a variable, you list the variable inside the parentheses.<br><br>

Run this example.  What does it print?  Why does it print that?</p>

<div class="code">
print "Welcome"

def hokeypokey(limb):
    print("You put your " + limb +" in,")
    print("You put your " + limb + " out,")
    print("You put your " + limb +" in,")
    print("and you shake it all about.")
    print("You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around,")
    print("and that's what it's all about!")
    print("")
    
print("Let's dance!!")
print("")
hokeypokey("left hand")
hokeypokey("right hand")
hokeypokey("left foot")
hokeypokey("right foot")
hokeypokey("head")
</div>

<p>The first line of code that actually runs is 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">print("Let's dance!!")</span>. After that (and the blank line)
then we <strong>call</strong> a function named hokeypokey that takes a string variable for body part.<br><br>

The indented lines of code above define the steps in the hokeypokey() function, but they don't run 
until they are told to.  To tell the function to run its code, you have to type 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">hokeypokey("some body part")</span>.  This 
is referred to as <strong>calling</strong> the function.</p>

<p>Go to the next box in Jupyter after the code above.  Try running the following.
What does it do?</p>

<div class="code">hokeypokey("zzzzzzz")
</div>

<p>Go to the next box in Jupyter after the code above.  Try running the following.
What does it do?</p>

<div class="code">hokeypokey()
</div>

<p>Try putting this in an empty box in Jupyter and running it.  What does it do?</p>

<div class="code">
def hokeypokey(limb):
    print("You put your " + limb +" in,")
    print("You put your " + limb + " out,")
    print("You put your " + limb +" in,")
    print("and you shake it all about.")
    print("You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around,")
    print("and that's what it's all about!")
    print("")
</div>

<p>A function can also be used with numbers, and with any number of 
variables as <strong>input parameters</strong>.  Just like you saw 
above, the variable's value is set when the function is called.  So
here, the first call makes a=1, b=2, c=3.  The second call makes 
a=10, b=10, c=10.  And the third call makes a=1, b=1, c=1.<br><br>

A <strong>return value</strong> is the value that the function sends
back after it's done.  It takes the place of the function call, just as
if the function call itself were a variable.<br><br>

What does this function do? Run it.  Did it match your intuition?</p>

<div class="code">def mystery(a, b, c):
    return(a + b + c)

testValue = mystery(1, 2, 3)
print("Test value is ", testValue)

print(mystery(10, 10, 10))
print(mystery(1, 1, 1))
</div>

<p>Notice that when you pass values to a function for its input 
parameters, the names don't have to match up.  The only thing that
matters is what order you put them in.<br><br>

What does this code print?  Try to figure it out on paper first.  
Watch the functions and return values carefully.</p>

<div class="code">def mult(a, b):
    return a * b

def sub(first, second):
    return first - second

def half(num):
    return num / 2


x = 50
y = 10
print(sub(half(mult(x, y)), x))
</div>

<div style="margin: 10px;">If you need hints and the solution, slowly highlight the text in this gray box from top to bottom.</div>
<div class="hint"><pre>Work from the middle out.
print(sub(half(mult( x,  y)),  x))
print(sub(half(mult(50, 10)),  x))
print(sub(half(   500      ),  x))
print(sub(        250       ,  x))
print(sub(        250       , 50))
print(            200            )
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Single Responsibility</h3>

<p>How much code should go inside a function?</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that a function should have a single responsibility.  It should
have one job to do, and do that job well, and not worry about any other jobs.  Well, that's
kind of vague... how do I decide what's one job?  It really depends on the problem you're 
trying to solve.</p>

<p>Let's say I'm writing code
to alphabetize a bunch of words.  To put them in order, I need to know which word is 
alphabetically less than all the other words.  I could write a function to compare one 
word to a whole list of words... but if I break down the idea into smaller steps, I find out
that one "step" is to compare just two words, and determine which of the two is earlier
in the alphabet.  So it would make sense to make a function that compares just two words, and
returns whichever one comes first in the alphabet.  Then I could write another function that 
goes through the list of words, and finds the earliest word each time through, to gradually put the
whole list in order.  One function's entire job is "compare two words" while another function's
entire job is "run through the list of words".</p>

<p>When you're first learning to program, it's not always obvious where to put that dividing
line.  Sometimes you have to experiment to see what makes sense.  One limitation to keep in
mind is that you only get one return value, so whatever your function does, it can only give
one answer.  So you have to keep its responsibilities very narrow and focused.</p>

<li>A return value comes back from the function when it finishes running, and takes its place in 
the calling code.</li>
<li>A function definition includes only the indented lines immediately beneath it.</li>
<li>Function definitions can include any code, including indented if blocks, just like you would 
use anywhere else.  They can even call other functions.</li>
