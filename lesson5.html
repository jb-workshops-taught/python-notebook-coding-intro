<h1>While Loops</h1>

<p>A while loop runs as long as the condition is true.</p>

<div class="code">count = 0
while (count < 5):
   print "Still going! ", count
   count = (count + 1)
print "All done!"
</div>

<p>The indented code repeats as long as the comparison at the top of the loop
remains true.  When the comparison is no longer true, then the loop finishes,
and the code after the loop runs.</p>

<p>Guess what the code above prints.  Then run it in Jupyter and see if you're right.</p>

<p>You can also use a boolean variable to control the loop, and change the boolean variable's
value inside the loop while it's running, to stop the loop. (You were introduced to boolean
values in lesson 3, "If Statements" - review that if you are unsure.)</p>

<div class="code">word = ""
keepGoing = True

print "Guess the magic word."
while(keepGoing == True):
    word = input("What is the word? ")
    if (word == "magic"):
        print "We love magic!"
    elif (word == "quit"):
        keepGoing = False
    else:
        print "You typed ", word

print "All done!"

</div>

<p>Run that example.  Try typing in the following words, in order:<br>
<div class="code">sesame
apple
room
magic
buzz
quit
</div>

<p>What runs before the loop?  What runs after the loop ends?</p>

<P>When does the loop repeat?  When does it stop?</p>

<p>Atalia wants to write an adding machine.  As long as the user of
the program keeps typing in numbers, the program will keep adding
them up.  When the user types in zero, then the program ends.  How can
she use a while loop to write this program?  There are multiple ways
to do this.  The example below shows one of them.</p>

<div class="code">sum = 0
number = 1
while (number != 0):
    number = input("How much to add? ")
    sum = sum + number
    print "Sum is ", sum
</div>
<div class="code">How much to add? 3
Sum is  3
How much to add? 5
Sum is  8
How much to add? 7
Sum is  15
How much to add? 1
Sum is  16
How much to add? 0
Sum is  16
</div>

<h2>While Loops: Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Recognize when a loop is a useful strategy.</li>
<li>Choose a meaningful comparison to control the loop.</li>
<li>Understand how to apply a while loop to a real situation.</li>
<li>Make good choices about what goes before the loop, inside the loop, and after the loop.</li>
</ol>

<h2>While Loops: Concepts Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>A while loop repeats the indented set of code as long as the comparison at the top remains true.</li>
<li>The un-indented lines are not part of the loop.</li>
<li>Pay attention to what condition triggers the end of the loop.</li>
</ol>
