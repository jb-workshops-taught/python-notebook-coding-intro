<h1>What are programming languages?  How are they similar or different?</h1>

<p>Right now, you're learning programming using the python programming language.
There are other programming languages as well, including C, C++ (c plus plus), Java,
PHP, JavaScript, and many others.  Programming languages have a lot in common, so the
concepts that you learn here will be applicable everywhere.  But, the exact details of
what to type in are a little different.  The exact words, punctuation, and grammer are
called <strong>syntax</strong>, and it varies somewhat between languages.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we will demonstrate how syntax looks a little different between python 
and C, just so you can see what that's like.  You won't be able to run the C examples.  They're 
just for looking at.</p>

<p>Every language has variables, functions, and loops.  The way they're written is a little
different in each, but you can plan the code similarly anyway.  Now let's look at a specific
example: a for-loop counts from a start number to an end number.</p>

<h1>For Loops and Arrays</h1>

<p>A <strong>for loop</strong> is a convenient way of counting, with fewer lines of code than a while loop.
Here's an example.</p>

<div class="code"># Python example 
for counter in range(0, 9):
    print counter
print "Done."
</div>

<p>In python (what you're using right now), for loops work with "range" by walking
through a list of numbers.  In other languages, for loops work with a comparison just
like while loops do.  As an example, here's a for loop in C (this won't run in Jupyter).<br><br>

The C for loop has 3 areas.  (create a variable ; check a comparison ; change the value of the variable).
As long as the condition remains true, the for loop will keep repeating.  (This should sound
familiar from the while loops.)  With a while loop, you create the variable ahead of the loop, check
the comparison at the while loop first line, and change the value inside the loop.  A for loop is
a shortcut way of writing that.
</p>

<div class="code" style="background-color: #CCCCFF;">// C example (won't run in Jupyter)
for (int counter = 0; counter < 9; counter++) 
{
   printf("%d ", counter)
}
</div>

<p>The purpose of a for loop is to count from a starting number to an ending number.  This
means you know exactly how many times it will go through the loop.  Let's use a bar
graph as an example.</p>

<div class="code"># Python so you can run it
bar = ""
for width in range(0, 12):
    bar = bar + "#"
print bar
</div>

<p>A <strong>for loop</strong> is also commonly used paired with an <strong>array</strong>.  An
array is a series of variables, all in a row like train cars.  Here's an example.</p>

<div class="code"># Arrays
children = ["Sally", "Bobby", "Tommy", "Tonya"]
ages = [12, 9, 7, 5]

print "Sally's age is ", ages[0]
print "Bobby's age is ", ages[1]
print "Tommy's age is ", ages[2]
print "Tonya's age is ", ages[3]

for count in range(0, 4):
    print "Child ", children[count], " is ", ages[count], " years old."
</div>

<p>At a specific index (location) in an array, there is a specific value.  In
the children array, index 0 has value "Sally".  Index 1 has value "Bobby".
Index 2 has value "Tommy", and index 3 has value "Tonya".  It's common to 
draw an array on paper with the values inside boxes and the index along the
bottom.  The name of the array variable goes on the left.
</p>

<div style="background-color: white; width: 600px; padding: 10px;">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="500">
<tr>
<td style="" align="right" width="100" height="40" valign="middle">children&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;" align="center" width="70" height="40">"Sally"</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;" align="center" width="70" height="40">"Bobby"</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;" align="center" width="70" height="40">"Tommy"</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;" align="center" width="70" height="40">"Tonya"</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;" align="center" width="70" height="40">&nbsp;</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;" align="center" width="70" height="40">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">4</td>
<td align="center">5</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>As you've seen, an array is a way of storing a list of related values.  Here's an 
array of temperatures and the day each high temp occurred.  How would you use a for loop 
to walk through this list and print the day number and the temperature for each?</p>

<div class="code"># July temperatures
day   = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
temp  = [81, 82, 80, 75, 74, 80, 78, 75, 72, 74, 76]

# print something like:
# July 10: High of 81
# July 11: High of 82
# ...
</div>

<p>You can also change the value of an item in the array, by assigning to it just like
any other variable.  This is an important technique, especially when combined with a loop.</p>


<div class="code"># July temperatures
temp  = [81, 82, 80, 75, 74, 80, 78, 75, 72, 74, 76]

temp[0] = 65
temp[5] = 72
</div>

<p>Here are some deeper examples of how you can use arrays and loops together
to get intersting results.</p>

<div class="code"># Add 4 to every number.
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
for index in range(0, 6):
    numbers[index] = numbers[index] + 4
    print "The value at location ", index, " is value ", numbers[index]
</div>

<div class="code"># Calculate the average (add them up, then divide)
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
sum = 0
for index in range(0, 6):
    sum = sum + numbers[index]
print "The total is ", sum
print "The average is ", (sum / 7)
</div>
