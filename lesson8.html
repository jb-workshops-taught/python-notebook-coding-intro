<h1>How do computers understand or work with words and sentences?</h1>

<div>A computer only really stores numbers.  How does it display text if it's all
numbers inside?  Based on a variable's data type being "character" or "string" it knows that those
numbers are supposed to represent letters, and it automatically shows you the letter version.
Let's see how we can work with the details of that.</div>


<h1>Characters</h1>

<p>A character is a single letter, space, or punctuation mark.  There are also some characters
that don't display on screen, but having meaning for the computer, such as newline which is
represented as \n and tells the computer "move the cursor down one line and all the way to
the left." Tab, escape, and the arrow keys are also special characters like that.</p>

<p>Inside the computer, each character is represented by a number.  The match between a number
and a specific character that it represents is called an <strong>encoding</strong>.  One
such encoding is <a href="http://www.ascii-code.com/">ASCII</a>.  The computer knows to print
the character to screen, but in its memory, it holds the number instead.  The ASCII number
for the letter 'a' is 97, while the ASCII number for the letter 'A' is 65.  Click through
the link above and see if you can figure out the decimal (DEC) ASCII numbers for:</p>
<ul>
<li>T</li>
<li>x</li>
<li>space</li>
<li>horizontal tab</li>
<li>carriage return</li>
<li>9</li>
<li>@</li>
</ul>


<p>A string is a list of characters, specifically, an array.  That means one letter after
another; you'll see a deeper example below.  For now, we're going to think about the ASCII
values inside it.<br><br>

Let's pretend we're writing a secret code.  We've caught a message from someone
and need to decipher the message.  Here's what we've got.  Can you figure out the rest, using
the ASCII chart linked above?  You don't need to program anything; just use a pencil and paper.</p>

<pre>
  M   e   e   t      m   e 
 77 101 101 116 32 109 101 32 97 116 32 116 104 101 32 98 97 114 110 32 97 116 32 56 58 48 48 46
</pre>

<p>Just for fun... here's a python example for changing between the ASCII number and the character.</p>

<div class="code">
asciiValue = ord('a')
print asciiValue

letterValue = chr(97)
print letterValue
</div>

<p>There are also encodings other than ASCII.  For example, Unicode UTF-8 provides for
representation of Chinese characters, Japanese kana and kanji, Korean, and so on.  You
may have noticed that ASCII only covers European language letters, so for true 
international programs, software, and websites, we need an encoding that supports
many other languages.  Working with text encodings is a bit more advanced, so we're
not covering it here.  If you want to explore this more,
use a search engine to look up <strong>internationalization</strong> and 
<strong>localization</strong> in software.</p>


<h1>Text (String) Processing</h1>

<p>Now we're going to forget about ASCII for a bit, and work with the actual
characters instead.</p>

<p>A string is a list of characters; behind the scenes, it's an array.
Check out these examples.</p>

<div class="code">name = "Jenny"
print name[1]

# 'e'
</div>

<p>How would you pull out the word "bet" from "alphabet" below?</p>

<div class="code">word = "alphabet"
shortie = ""
for index in range(5,8):
   shortie = shortie + word[index]

print shortie
</div>

<p>There's a shortcut for this.  Clipping a piece of a string out of a bigger one
is called getting a substring (a smaller piece of that string).  In python, this
can be done with slicing, using the range operator.  In other languages, you would usually 
call a substring function and give it a start and end location.  Either way, the
result is the same: you get back another string.  Here's the python example.</p>

<div class="code">word = "alphabet"
print word[5:8]
</div>

<p>You can loop through the array of characters and handle them individually.</p>

<div class="code">name = "santa claus"
upper = ""
for i in range(0, len(name)):
    upper = upper + name[i].capitalize()
print upper
</div>



<p>Here's a list of data.  We need to clean it up and split apart the 
day of week letter from the temperature measurement, so we can use it more effectively.  Let's
see how we can do that.</p>

<div class="code"># Data cleanup
data = [ "M75", "T73", "W74", "R72", "F76", "S79", "N76" ]

days = ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""]
temps = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

for i in range(0,7):
    mixed = data[i]
    days[i] = mixed[0:1]
    temps[i] = mixed[1:3]
    print "Day ", days[i], " had temp ", temps[i]
</div>

<p>It's really common to read data from a file and then clean it up
before you can use it for processing.  Sometimes the way the data is structured
matched a different system, not the one you're writing, and you're just
borrowing the data.<br><br>

String manipulations are necessary during the cleanup process.  Here are some
useful tricks. We'll start with counting and indexing.</p>

<div class="code"># String tricks
sentence = "This is 1 example sentence for string manipulations."
print sentence
print "How many e's are in it? ", sentence.count("e")

firste = sentence.find("e")
print "What's after the first e?", sentence[firste:firste+10]
</div>

<p>This one explores the function calls.</p>

<div class="code"># String tricks

print "Is the first letter alphabetic? ", sentence[0].isalpha()
print "Is the 9th letter alphabetic? ", sentence[8].isalpha()
print "What is the 9th letter? ", sentence[8]
print "Okay then, is the 9th letter a digit? ", sentence[8].isdigit()
print "Is the first letter lowercase? ", sentence[0].islower()
print "Is the 5th letter a space? ", sentence[4].isspace()
print "\n"

</div>

<p>Python is pretty nice about checking the entire
string automatically rather than just one character.</p>

<div class="code"># String tricks
word = "JENNY"
print "Is the entire word uppercase? ", word.isupper()
print "\n"
</div>

<p>You can always replace something inside a string with something else,
whether it's one letter or an entire substring.  You can also split
on a specific character or substring, and get back a list of the parts.</p>

<div class="code"># String tricks
print "What happens if we replace every e with E? "
print sentence.replace("e", "E")

nametext = "Jenny, Jimmy, Sally, Tonya, Linda, Wu"
names = nametext.split(",")
print names
</div>

<p>You can also check whether a string starts or ends with another string.</p>


<div class="code"># String tricks
if("Sunny".startswith("Sun")):
    print "Matches"

if("Sunday".endswith("day")):
    print "Matches"
</div>

<div>You can find more information on the string functions in the python docs.
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods</a></div>

<p>Here's some data processing.  To read the data, split it into lines, and then 
split each line on the : to separate the date from the high-low pair.  Then the 
portion before the H is the daily high temp and the portion before the L is the daily low temp.</p>

<div class="code">data = "2015-07-01:75H65L\n2015-07-02:78H66L\n2015-07-03:77H68L\n2015-07-04:80H69L"
rows = data.splitlines()

for i in range(0,len(rows)):
    row = rows[i]
    # Split returns a list, but we can immediately stick those in variables.
    (date, temps) = row.split(":")
    high = temps[0:2]
    low = temps[3:5]
    print "Date ", date, " high ", high, " low ", low
</div>
<div class="code">
Date  2015-07-01  high  75  low  65
Date  2015-07-02  high  78  low  66
Date  2015-07-03  high  77  low  68
Date  2015-07-04  high  80  low  69
</div>

<p>String processing <strong>concepts</strong> are the same in various programming languages, but
the syntax can be different.  Python makes it particularly easy.  You will find that
trying to do this in C takes more lines of code and more loops to accomplish it.</p>
