<h1>Bonus: Data Processing and Graphing</h1>

<p>You've been working on string processing and pulling apart weirdly formatted
data so it can be more easily handled.  This is tremendously useful for cleaning data
ahead of graphing and scientific analysis.  Now, you get a chance to see that applied.</p>

<p>The tools you learn about in this lesson won't apply directly to other programming 
languages.  The libraries and syntax are different.  The ideas are the same, though; you
clean up the data, get it into organized structures such as arrays or lists, and
then you can have the computer graph the data or run statistics on it.</p>

<p>This is basically a demo, not hands-on practice.  If you enjoy working with
data and data analysis, you may want to consider courses in data science, business intelligence,
data visualization, or scientific computing. In python, the libraries to learn are
numpy, pandas, and seaborn.</p>

<p>The demo will require you to save and upload two files this time.  One is the lesson file.
The other is the data it will be graphing.  You must upload them both.  Then open the lesson file.
Then choose "Cell" menu, "Run All" and give it a couple minutes to run.</p>

<h2>Data Processing: Concepts Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>String processing is often used to prepare data for graphing and analysis.</li>
<li>We can learn from data when it's well organized.</li>
<li>Pandas is a python library that makes it easy to work with data frames (rows and columns of data).</li>
<li>Pandas data frames can be easily graphed with tools like the Seaborn graphing library.</li>
<li>NumPy is a numerical python library for working with matrices (rows/columns of data) and operating
mathematically on them.</li>
</ol>
