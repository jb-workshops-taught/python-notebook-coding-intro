<h1>Bonus: Data Processing and Graphing</h1>

<p>You've been working on string processing and pulling apart weirdly formatted
data so it can be more easily handled.  This is tremendously useful for cleaning data
ahead of graphing and scientific analysis.  Now, you get a chance to see that applied.</p>

<p>The tools you learn about in this lesson won't apply directly to other programming 
languages.  The libraries and syntax are different.  The ideas are the same, though; you
clean up the data, get it into organized structures such as arrays or lists, and
then you can have the computer graph the data or run statistics on it.</p>

<p>This is basically a demo, not hands-on practice.  If you enjoy working with
data and data analysis, you may want to consider courses in data science, business intelligence,
data visualization, or scientific computing. In python, the libraries to learn are
numpy, pandas, and seaborn.</p>

<p>You'll need the downloaded exercises file for the demo; go there now.</p>
